>> WDBearManager 2006-09-14 by kizura // 1.2.7-W1.12.0 <<

o Plugin mechanism improved.
  Please d/l a sample plugin from
  http://filebeam.com/75936fc9141bdfdcbdbf7db7ed0952c0
  Just unpack and make sure it resides in the folder "plugins/mango"
  If you want to write your own patchDB.xml, please take a look at
  the forum - Syntax is identical to that of patchSCP.xml
  This plugin was made for the Mangos database.

o log4j.xml can now be edited (was inside the jar before)
o WDBTXT: added compatibility checks
o Import WDB files: replaced \r\n with "\r\n" (text)
o Changed plugin mechanism
  Now every plugin must reside in a directory below the "plugins" folder
  The name of the jar and the properties file must be the same like
  the folder (Please expect a demo coming soon)
o Error in db update - Script dropped table "questcache"
  But "creaturecache" should have been dropped - fixed
o Typo in itemcache.xml
  wdb_RequiredSkillRank -> added a blank // fixed (no db update needed)
o Typo in questcache.xml
  wdb_RewSpell
  wdb_StartingItemID
  wdb_Subdescription
  -> added a blank // fixed (no db update needed)
o Fixed duplicate or multiple occurrence problem
  Since the implementation of LOCALE there was a bug
  concerning UPDATE.
  It overwrote values from other locales, fixed now.
  Please re-import old data (disable UPDATE)
  Thanks to Mulder/Darkman for showing me this issue.
