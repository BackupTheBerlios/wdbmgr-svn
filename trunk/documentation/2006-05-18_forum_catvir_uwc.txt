Hi,

I developped a program with the help of many others to read
the contents of the WDB folder.
The project exists since > 1 year.

<please ignore if you already know about WDB>
The WDB folder is a client cache that contains parts the information
that bli$$ sends to your client.
The w0w server sends information to your client.
The client saves parts of this information inside the WDB folder to reduce network traffic (Infos about quests, items, npcs, etc). This program enables the user to read the information stored there.
</please ignore if you already know about WDB>

With the latest version 1.0 you can read all WDB files from version 1.2
till 1.10. If bli$$ releases a new WDB format, you can enhance the client
with XML files to understand the new format.

The project is OpenSource (GPL) and it is my contribute to the
community.
If you like the program, please donate money to a charity organization
of your choice.
